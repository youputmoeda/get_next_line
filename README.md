>*"Reading a line on a fd is way too tedious"*

Summary: The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.
